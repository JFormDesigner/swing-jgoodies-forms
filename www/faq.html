	<h4><a name="What_are_the_main_benefits">What are the main benefits of the JGoodies Forms?</a></h4>

	<p>
	The JGoodies Forms aims to make the layout process faster, better and easier. 
	It has been designed to make simple things easy and the hard stuff possible, 
	good design easy and the bad difficult.	
	</p>
	

	<h4><a name="commercial_use">Can I use the Forms in a commercial product?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can use, copy and redistribute the JGoodies Forms in source and binary form
	- even for commercial use - if you comply with the very relaxed terms 
	of the <a href="../LICENSE.txt">BSD open source license</a>.
	The BSD license has been chosen, because it allows many uses,
	and the few license terms are short and human readable, 
	even if you're not a lawyer.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="How_to_get_started">How to get started?</a></h4>
	<p>
	First, open and read the README.html and check the available documentation:
	the <em>RELEASE-NOTES</em>, <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Reference</em>, 
	<em>API Docs (JavaDocs)</em>, <em>Tips &amp; Tricks</em>, 
	and <em>Pointers</em> to Visual Builders and other online resources.
	Then study the <em>Advanced Layout</em> presentation or the
	JGoodies Forms <em>Whitepaper</em>; both are available at 
	the <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/">JGoodies articles</a> page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Forms tutorial is an important part of this distribution. 
	It demonstrates different ways to use the Forms library, and
	some typical pitfalls. The tutorial sources ship in folder <tt>src/tutorial</tt>.  
	It is strongly recommended to download and run the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/formsdemo/index.html">JGoodies Forms Demo</a>.
	This demo contains many Forms tutorial examples
	and will aquaint you with the library features.

	<h4><a name="Which_layout_managers_complement">Which layout managers complement the FormLayout?</a></h4>

	<p>
	<a href="http://www.zookitec.com/explicitlayout.html">ExplicitLayout</a>
	complements the FormLayout when it comes to non-rectangular layouts, 
	for example if you want to position components along a curve.
	The <a href="https://explicit-tablelayout.dev.java.net/">Explicit Table Builder</a>
	adds a few things that the pure ExplicitLayout is missing
	such as builders, layout styles, support for Dialog Units (dlu), 
	and a nice debug panel.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Matisse visual builder (integrated with Netbeans) 
	makes it easy for many people to get layouts done quickly.
	It seems that Matisse has been designed for visual building,
	but the underlying GroupLayout can be used without Matisse.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	The highly extensible SpringLayout can implement a huge class of layouts,
	but it is quite difficult to understand.
	You may consider using it in the rare case where 
	neither FormLayout nor ExplicitLayout do a good job,
	or if you want to implement a non-grid-based layout with a layout manager
	that ships with the JDK.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	Although the FormLayout is intended to replace the GridBagLayout,
	the latter is still a resonable choice, if you cannot add a third party
	layout manager like the FormLayout to your project. 
	The <a href="https://packer.dev.java.net/">Packer</a> simplifies 
	the use of GridBagLayout.
	</p>	
		
		
		
	<h4><a name="Are_there_visual_builders">Are there visual builders that support the FormLayout?</a></h4>

	<p>
	There are a couple of visual builders that support the JGoodies FormLayout 
	and/or the whole Forms framework  including the factories and 
	non-visual builders. Among others: Abeille Forms Designer, 
	JAXFront, JBeaver, JFormDesigner, Jigloo, FormBuilder, Form Layout Maker,
	JFormComposer, Mogwai FormMaker, and the WindowBuilder Pro.
	See the <em>visual builders</em> section in the Forms README.html.
	</p>
			
		
		
	<h4><a name="Can_I_use_FormLayout_with_the_SWT">Can I use the FormLayout with the SWT?</a></h4>

	<p>
	Florian Fankhauser has ported the FormLayout and parts
	of the Forms builders to the SWT,
	see <a href="http://ffxml.net/swtforms/">SwtForms</a>.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="2.1">How to give columns a percentage of the available space?</a></h4>

	<p>
	If all components have an initial size of 0 pixel, then the resize
	weight can be used as percentage of the available space. 
	For example <tt>&quot;0:g(0.25), 0:g(0.75)&quot;</tt> gives the first column
	25% of the available space and the second column 75%.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	More generally, the resize weights distribute the available
	extra space of the growing columns/rows. The extra space is
	<i>container space - insets -  fixed space</i>.
	</p>

		
	
	<h4><a name="2.2">How to assign the same width to two or more columns?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can either use the same constant size for all columns,
	or you can group the columns using <tt>FormLayout#setColumnGroups(int[][])</tt>.
	The latter mechanism gives columns in a group the same width
	after their normal width has been computed.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	The distribution of extra space is the last step; it happens
	after the group elements have been equalized. To make columns
	equal wide, ensure that they have the same growing weight assigned
	(the default is <tt>1.0</tt>).
	</p>	
		
	
	
	<h4><a name="2.3">How can I append a custom row using the DefaultFormBuilder?</a></h4>
	
	<p>
	You can append a custom row using <tt>DefaultFormBuilder#appendRow(RowSpec)</tt>.
	However, you may consider using a combination of standard rows 
	to achieve a more regular layout grid and regular layout row heights
	and row alignments.
	</p>
	
	<p>	
	The Forms tutorial contains the <tt>DefaultFormWithCustomRowsExample</tt> class
	that demonstrates three approaches for appending a custom row.
	These differ in the position of the leading label, the alignment 
	of font baselines and the height of the custom row.
	</p>

		
		
	<h4><a name="2.4">How to assign the same width to two or more columns?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can append a custom area using <tt>DefaultFormBuilder#appendRow(RowSpec)</tt>.
	However, you may consider using a standard row to better align the
	leading label. Another alternative is to separate the custom area
	with a titled separator.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	The Forms tutorial contains the <tt>DefaultFormWithCustomAreasExample</tt>
	that demonstrates three approaches for appending a custom area at the bottom
	of a form.
	These differ in the position of the leading label, the alignment 
	of font baselines and the way the area is separated from the rest.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="2.5">How can I identify and understand layout problems?</a></h4>

	<p>
	Forms ships with two classes that help you debug layouts:
	<tt>FormDebugPanel</tt> paints the layout grid and helps you understand
	how you have specified the layout grid and positioned the components
	in the grid.
	Class <tt>FormDebugUtils</tt> dumps detailed information about the
	grid, groups, component cell positions, component cell constraints, 
	component positions, and container size.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	The Forms tutorial contains the <tt>FormDebugExample</tt> that demonstrates
	how to use these two classes.
	</p>	
		
		
		
	<h4><a name="2.6">How can I remove a component from the layout?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You don't remove a component from layout but from the layout container.
	The container holds a list of layout components. Often the container
	is a <tt>JPanel</tt> or a JPanel subclass.
	To remove a component from the container invoke <tt>Container#remove</tt>.
	You can remove all components using <tt>Container#removeAll</tt>.
	</p>	
		
	

	<h4><a name="3.1">What does the 'fill' alignment do?</a></h4>

	<p>
	The horizontal and vertical fill alignments let a component consume 
	all the space in its display area, where the display area is the
	set of cells a component spans. For example a horizontal fill 
	positions the component's left-hand side at the left side of 
	the display area and the component's right-hand side at the right-hand
	side of the display area. 
	</p>

	
	
	<h4><a name="3.2">When is it recommended to use the 'pref' size instead of 'default'?</a></h4>

	<p>
	First off, 'pref' and 'default' differ only if a panel can be resized. 
	As long as there's enough space in the container to give all components 
	their desired preferred sizes, the 'default' size is equal to the 
	'pref' size. This is the case for all packed panels.
	If the panel is then shrinked, the 'pref' size would cut off some
	components, where the 'default' size shrinks them down until
	the minimum size is reached.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	To make a layout easier to understand favor 'pref' over 'default' 
	if 'default' adds no value, for example if the panel cannot be resized.
	Otherwise a rule of thumb is to favor 'default' over 'pref' for 
	columns and 'pref' over 'default' for rows. 
	</p>

		
		
	<h4><a name="3.3">Why don't components in growing rows fill the vertical space?</a></h4>

	<p>
	Forms has been designed to reduce the layout code for frequently used layouts.
	I've found that the bulk of form-oriented panels requires components to be
	filled horizontally and centered vertically. These settings are 
	the defaults for the column and row alignments. 
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	If you want a component fill the vertical space, you can configure
	the row or the component's cell constraints. If you want all components
	in a row fill the space, use a <i>fill</i> alignment: 
	<tt>fill:&lt;size&gt;:&lt;growing&gt;</tt>. 
	If you want a component fill the space, use an extended
	cell constraint specification: <tt>cc.xy(3, 1, "fill, fill")</tt>
	where the second <tt>fill</tt> is responsible for filling the vertical space.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	See also class <tt>VerticalGrowthExample</tt> in the Forms tutorial sources.
	</p>
	
	

	<h4><a name="3.4">Why don't components that span multiple columns affect the column widths?</a></h4>

	<p>
	Components that span multipe columns/rows are excluded from 
	the computation of the column widths and row heights respectively.
	I couldn't find an appropriate algorithm how to expand the columns/rows 
	if a large component spans them; either the algorithm leads to good layout 
	but is difficult to understand, or it's easy to understand but 
	leads to poor layout.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	If a component must expand the columns or rows it must be in 
	a single column. If necessary, you can move the columns/rows
	it spans to a sublayout.
	</p>

	<p>		
	If you want such components affect the spanned columns/rows, 
	specify that they shall grow. See also the next question.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="3.5">Why do components that span multiple columns affect the container width?</a></h4>
		
	<p>
	Unlike the column expansion mentioned in the previous question,
	it is quite easy to let components that span multipe columns/rows
	grow the container width or height respectively. 
	This way it is guaranteed that such components are fully contained
	if you pack the container.
	</p>
		
		

	<h4><a name="3.6">Why do some text areas grow but never shrink again?</a></h4>
		
	<p>
	In some configurations the JTextArea shows an unexpected sizing behavior.
	It then computes its minimum and preferred sizes based on 
	the size previously set by the layout manager or application code.
	Find below information what happens, which configurations are affected,
	and how to setup the text area and layout properly. Some of the
	combinations mentioned below are demonstrated in the pitfalls section
	of the Forms tutorial, see class <tt>GrowingTextAreaExample</tt>.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	An example of such an ever-growing area is a JTextArea with line wrap enabled, 
	put into a growing FormLayout column ('fill:pref:grow') of a resizable panel. 
	If the panel is layed out the layout manager computes the position
	and size for each component. Every component has then a size set.
	Lets say the area has an initial size of (100,&nbsp;32).
	Now if you make the panel wider, the growing column will assign
	a large width to the area, let's say (150,&nbsp;32). Since then the
	column won't shrink below 150 pixel. Why? The area's preferred size
	is now (150,&nbsp;32), more generally in this configuration the area's 
	minimum and preferred sizes is the size set previously.
	Since the preferred width is 150, the FormLayout will use a minimum
	of 150 for the area's column - still allowing it to grow.
	If you make the panel even wider, the FormLayout will set an even
	larger size to the text area, let's say (200,&nbsp;32). 
	The area's column then won't shrink below 200, because the area's 
	preferred width now increased to 200.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	To handle this situation you can a) change the layout specification,
	b) change the JTextArea configuration, or c) use a different JTextArea
	preferred size computation.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	A) A simple way to avoid this resize problem is to use a constant
	column or row size, for example '150dlu' or for growing columns/rows
	'fill:150dlu:grow', where 150dlu is the initial size that can grow.
	Since the dialog units are based on the dialog font this is an 
	appropriate sizing unit and layout specification. It works with
	all JTextArea configurations, regardless whether the area is wrapped
	by a JScrollPane or not.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	B) Some JTextArea configurations do not compute the minimum and
	preferred size based on the size set previously. For example 
	if you have hand-wrapped text (using '\n') and disable the
	line wrap feature, the minimum and preferred sizes are constant.
	You can put such areas in columns and row specified with 'pref'.
	Another alternative is to give the text area a custom minimum size
	and specify the column or row as 'default' or 'fill:default:grow'.
	Since the 'default' size can shrink a column/row down to its
	minimum width/height, this approach avoids the ever-growing case too.
	However, the minimum size must be specified in pixel and 
	typically in screen design you should favor non-pixel sizes.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	C) If you put a JTextArea in a JScrollPane the preferred size
	used for the scrollable view can be based on the area's #columns 
	and #rows properties. For example if you use <tt>area.setColumns(40)</tt>
	the scrollpane will have a width of about 40 characters. 
	Another approach is to implement a JTextArea subclass
	or a custom TextAreaUI to compute the preferred size independent
	of the area's size.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	Why doesn't this happen with the BorderLayout?
	Layout managers have two tasks: they must layout components in a 
	container and must compute the container's minimum, preferred 
	and maximum size.
	BorderLayout honors the content's preferred size when computing
	the container's preferred size. But it ignores the component's
	preferred size when it lays out the container. If you put
	a JTextArea in a BorderLayout center, the whole container has 
	the same preferred size as the text area. If you shrink the container,
	the BorderLayout ignores the text area's preferred size and
	it ignores even its minimum size. Hence it will shrink down 
	the container even below the area's minimum size.
	</p>
