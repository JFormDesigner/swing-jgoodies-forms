/**
 * A general purpose panel builder that uses the {@link FormLayout}
 * to lay out <code>JPanel</code>s. In addition to its superclass
 * {@link PanelBuilder} this class provides convenience behavior to map
 * resource keys to their associated internationalized (i15d) strings
 * when adding labels, titles and titled separators.<p>
 *
 * The localized texts used in methods <code>#addI15dLabel</code>
 * and <code>#addI15dTitle</code> can contain an optional mnemonic marker.
 * The mnemonic and mnemonic index are indicated by a single ampersand
 * (<tt>&amp;</tt>). For example <tt>&quot;&amp;Save&quot</tt>, or
 * <tt>&quot;Save&nbsp;&amp;as&quot</tt>. To use the ampersand itself,
 * duplicate it, for example <tt>&quot;Look&amp;&amp;Feel&quot</tt>.<p>
