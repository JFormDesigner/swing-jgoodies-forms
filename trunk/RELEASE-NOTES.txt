                           JGoodies Forms
                            Release Notes
                        

CHANGES IN 1.8.0  -----------------------------------------------------

    This version is binary incompatible with previous versions. However
    migration is easy, because only rarely used features and internal
    interfaces have changed. Just check whether you set default values
    that have been moved to the new FormsSetup class.
    
    
    The internal interface StringLocalizer from JGoodies Common 1.7
    has been renamed to StringResourceAccessor, and it has been
    slightly extended. To migrate, update to the JGoodies Common 1.8.
    
    o Fixed the conversion from DTP points to pixels.
    o Added Forms#buttonStack, #checkBoxStack, #radioButtonStack.
    o Added ButtonBarBuilder#create().
    o Added ButtonStackBuilder#create().
    o Moved all global default values to the new FormsSetup:
      opaque, label-for feature, factory, debug tooltips.
    o PanelBuilder's label-for feature honors if a label 
      is already labelling a component.
    o Added FormLayout#setColumnGroup(int... indices)
    o Added FormLayout#setRowGroup(int... indices)
    o FormLayout#setColumnGroups and #setRowGroups check 
      that each group of indices contains at least two indices.
    o Added CellConstraints#translate(int dx, int dy).
    o FormSpecs can tell whether the default alignment has been
      explicitly set.
    o Added a special "none" column alignment intended only 
      for JTable column configurations as implemented 
      by the classes TableUtils and TableColumns.
    o Smaller gaps on the Mac.
    o Column and row specs accept a 0 multiplier, e.g. "0*(p, $lg)".
    o Improved parser message for negative multiplier designation.
     

CHANGES IN 1.7.2  -----------------------------------------------------

    o Fixed ButtonStackBuilder layout that does no longer 
      group the layout rows for the contained buttons.
      Unlike the old behavior, invisible buttons now reduce
      the layout size of the button stack. Also, we could now 
      potentially switch the 'honorsVisibility' property.
    o Fixed exception message references to API methods 
      that have been replaced.
    o Fixed ListViewBuilder argument check messages.
    o Added ListViewBuilder#focusTraversal to specify
      a custom focus traversal policy.
    o ListViewBuilder allows to use custom headers.
    

CHANGES IN 1.7.1  -----------------------------------------------------

    o Requires the JGoodies Common 1.6.0.
    o Added ListViewBuilder#honorsVisibility to enable API users
      to keep the overall layout stable, even if a sub view, 
      for example a details view, becomes invisible.
    o The ListViewBuilder sets names for unnamed components and
      those that are implicitly created by the builder.
    o Added ListViewBuilder#namePrefix to specify a prefix for
      the component names set by the builder.
    o Fixed docs.
    o Updated copyright date.


CHANGES IN 1.7.0  -----------------------------------------------------

    o Removed deprecated classes, methods, and constants.
    o Fixed Forms#centered, #horizontal, #vertical.
    o Added PanelBuilder#focusTraversal(FocusTraversalPolicy).
    o Completed JavaDocs for the Forms class.
    o Fixed some @since tags.
    o Compiled against the JGoodies Common 1.5.
    o Source code cleanup.
    o Fixed and extended the pom.xml:
      - added schema
      - fixed scope for dependencies
      - added Maven Central deployer
      - added build data
    
    
CHANGES IN 1.6.0  -----------------------------------------------------

    This version is binary incompatible with previous releases.
    The vast majority of client code isn't affected, because primarily 
    internal interfaces and their implementations have changed.
    However, some changes may require a migration, for example 
    if you have used the deprecated ButtonBarFactory in the past. 


    VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES
    o Since 1.6 the PanelBuilder's opaque state is false by default,
      where it was true before. You can get the old behavior with: 
          PanelBuilder.setOpaqueDefault(true);
          
    o Since 1.6 the DefaultUnitConverter's default test string is
      BALANCED_AVERAGE_CHARACTER_TEST_STRING where it was "X" before.
      It is recommended to use the new default, because it scales
      better with new typefaces on modern windowing systems.
      You can get the old behavior with:
          DefaultUnitConverter.getInstance()
              .setAverageCharacterWidthTestString(
                  DefaultUnitConverter.OLD_AVERAGE_CHARACTER_TEST_STRING);
    
    OTHER CHANGES
    o Since 1.6 the PanelBuilder's label-for-feature is on by default.
      The new behavior is recommended. You can get the old behavior with:
          PanelBuilder.setLabelForFeatureEnabledDefault(false);
              
    o Overhauled the ComponentFactory interface:
      - merged ComponentFactory and ComponentFactory2
      - removed ComponentFactory2
      - added #createHeaderLabel(String)
      - DefaultComponentFactory implements ComponentFactory
    o Overhauled the I15dPanelBuilder:
      - merged it with its superclass AbstractI15dPanelBuilder
      - supports a general StringLocalizer for the String resource access
      - sets the initial "opaque" property value to false
    o Renamed FormFactory to FormSpecs.
    o Removed the deprecated ColumnSpec.MIDDLE; use CENTER instead.
    o Added ButtonBarBuilder
      - builds button bars in a platform-independent order
      - can add sequences of related buttons
    o Marked ButtonBarBuilder2 as deprecated; use ButtonBarBuilder.
    o ButtonBarBuilder, ButtonStackBuilder, and ButtonBarBuilder2
      build focus traversal groups for the contained buttons,
      if the JGoodies FocusTraversalUtils class is available.
    o Removed LayoutStyle#isLeftToRightButtonOrder() and its
      implementations in MacLayoutStyle and WindowsLayoutStyle.
    o Overhauled the ButtonStackBuilder
      - removed #ButtonStackBuilder(FormLayout, JPanel)
      - removed #addButtons
      - added configuration methods
      - changed superclass to AbstractButtonPanelBuilder
    o Changed names in Borders from DIALOG_BORDER to DIALOG,
      DLU14_BORDER to DLU14, ...
    o AbstractBuilder#setDefaultComponentFactory has been renamed to
      #setComponentFactoryDefault.
    o Fixed and added JavaDocs and JavaDoc comment examples.
    o Fixed the broken artifact id in the pom.xml.
      

JGoodies Forms 1.5.1 ------------------------------------------------------

    o Marked the ButtonBarFactory as deprecated. 
      This class will be removed from the next Forms version.
    o The javadocs, main and test sources are delivered as JARs.


JGoodies Forms 1.5.0 ------------------------------------------------------

    o Requires Java 6 and JGoodies Common 1.3.
    o Generified several members.
    o Removed the deprecated ButtonBarBuilder that has been replaced
      by the ButtonBarBuilder2 before.
    o Removed DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic that has been
      marked as deprecated and replaced by MnemonicUtils#configure before.
    o Marked ColumnSpec#MIDDLE as deprecated; use CENTER instead.
    o Minor implementation improvements.
    
    
JGoodies Forms 1.4.2 ------------------------------------------------------

    o Declared methods as static where possible.
    
    
JGoodies Forms 1.4.1 ------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed missing synchronization of the lazy LayoutMap creation.
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Requires JGoodies Common 1.2.0
    
    
JGoodies Forms 1.4.0 ------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

    This version requires Java 5 and the new JGoodies Common library.
    Make sure that you include jgoodies-common-1.1.1.jar or later 
    in your classpath when using this Forms version.
    
   
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    o Added LayoutStyle#getLabelComponentPadY().
    o Added ComponentFactory2#createButton(Action).
    o The handling of text with mnemonic markers ('&') has changed.
      However, the changes are minimal and most marked text won't
      be affected. Nothing changed for single mnemonic markers
      The difference is how ampersands are handled that shall not 
      mark the mnemonic character. In version 1.3 all these markers
      needed to be quoted - before and after the mnemonic marker.
      Since version 1.4 only the ampersands before the marker shall
      be quoted.
      
      Version 1.3            Version 1.4            Comment
      Save                   Save                   unchanged
      &Save                  &Save                  unchanged
      Save &as               Save &as               unchanged
      Look & Feel            Look & Feel            unchanged
      R&&D department        R&&D department        unchanged
      R&&D d&epartment       R&&D d&epartment       unchanged
      A&&B &GmbH&&Co KG      A&&B &GmbH&Co KG       change
      
      In the last line the ampersand in "mbH&Co KG" does not
      mark a mnemonic. It must be quoted in version 1.3, 
      it must not be quoted in 1.4.
    
 
NEW FEATURES

    o Added ${label-component-gap}, $lcgap, and $lcg as row variables.
    o Added AbstractBuilder as new builder superclass.
      It holds a ComponentFactory per instance, that is initialized
      using the global default ComponentFactory2 instance.
    o ButtonBarBuilder2 methods return the builder to allow cascades, 
       e.g.: builder.addButton(...).addSeparator().add(...) etc.
    o Added DefaultUnitConverter.MODERN_AVERAGE_CHARACTER_TEST_STRING.
    o Added DefaultUnitConverter.BALANCED_AVERAGE_CHARACTER_TEST_STRING.


OTHER CHANGES

    o Moved to Java 5: uses varargs and generics where appropriate.
    o All classes now use the Common class Preconditions
      to check preconditions on method state and parameters.
    o Adjusted and extended tests for handling mnemonics.
    o Moved tutorial sources and tutorial docs to the upcoming
      JGoodies Showcase application.

                           JGoodies Forms
                            Version 1.3.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This update adds a PanelBuilder feature to automatically 
    associate an added focusable component with a previously 
    added label, see class PanelBuilder. The component factory
    mechanism and the builder classes have been extended to create
    JLabels that are intended to label read-only components.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 66: Potential out of memory in DefaultUnitConverter.
    o Fixed a parse problem with commas in prototype strings,
      e.g. new FormLayout("pref, 'a,b', pref", "p");
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Added builder methods for labels that label read-only 
      components, see PanelBuilder#addROLabel and #addI15dROLabel
      in the AbstractI15dPanelBuilder.
    o Introduced the ComponentFactory2 interface for the creation
      of JLabels that label read-only components.
    o DefaultComponentFactory implements ComponentFactory2.
    o Added convenience methods #addButton to the ButtonStackBuilder
      that add given JButtons or JButtons created from given Actions. 
    o Added the CC factory class that vends CellConstraints.
      It allows to remove a line from typical builder code.
      
      This code:
           FormLayout layout = new FormLayout(...);
           PanelBuilder builder = new PanelBuilder(layout);
           CellConstraints cc = new CellConstraints();
           builder.add(...,  cc.xy (1, 1));
           builder.add(...,  cc.xyw(3, 1, 3));
         
      can be replaced by:
           FormLayout layout = new FormLayout(...);
           PanelBuilder builder = new PanelBuilder(layout);
           builder.add(...,  CC.xy (1, 1));
           builder.add(...,  CC.xyw(3, 1, 3));
         
    o Changed the Mac button minimum width from 39 to 54 dlu.
    o Changed the FormSpec parser to accept bounded sizes with
      constant lower and upper bound.
    o Changed the FormDebugPanel to paint dashes. 
    o Added tests for the labelFor feature.
    o DefaultComponentFactory creates JLabels that remove
      the trailing colon (':') - if any - from its accessible name.
      This in turn leads to improved accessible names for components
      labeled by FormsLabels via {@code #setLabelFor}.
    o Added tests for the accessible name in FormLabels.

                            Version 1.2.1
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes bugs when using multiple class loaders
    to use multiple Forms versions in a single application (where most
    applications load only a single Forms version). This version also
    comes with improved tutorial sources, and it ships a new feature
    in the source code extras that can automatically associate added 
    components with labels that have mnemonics, see the PanelBuilder2.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 63: Class Leak due to UIManager.addPropertyChangeListener()
    o Issue 64: ClassCastException when using different ClassLoaders.
    

OTHER CHANGES

    o AbstractFormBuilder#add(Component, CellConstraints) can be
      overridden in subclasses.
    o Added PanelBuilder2 to the source code extras. It provides
      a feature that shall be moved to the PanelBuilder in the next
      major version: associate a focusable component with a previously
      added label that has a mnemonic. This feature will be moved
      to the core PanelBuilder in the next release.
    o FormUtils#clearLookAndFeelBasedCaches is public.

                           JGoodies Forms
                            Version 1.2.0
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This update fixes bugs and brings several major improvements.
    It is binary incompatible with previous versions of the Forms;
    however the API changes don't affect typical application code.
    
    Version 1.2 is visually compatible with previous versions.
    Layouts specified with 1.0.7 or 1.1 are the same in 1.2. 
    The Forms 1.2 offer syntax extensions, layout variables,
    and rarely used code has been removed.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed the deprecated FormFactory#createColumnLayout methods.
    o Added #encode() to the Size interface.
          
      
NEW FEATURES

    o New syntax for encoded column and row specification:
      - layout variables, see the LayoutMap class comment for details.
      - bounded sizes
          [<constant size>,<logical size>]   // lower bound
          [<logical size>,<constant size>]   // upper bound
          [<constant>,<logical>,<constant>]  // lower and upper bound
          for example [30dlu, pref], [pref, 30dlu], [10dlu, pref, 30dlu]
      - multiplier "5*(p, 3dlu), p"
      - prototype strings "p, '123-456-789', p"
      - accepts string encodings with whitespace before a comma,
        for example "pref , pref"
    o Sizes#setDefaultUnit(Unit) allows to set the unit that is used
      for constant sizes without explicit unit, e.g. "21".
      As of the Forms 1.2 the default is still ConstantSize.PIXEL.
      Sizes.setDefaultUnit(null) sets it to Dialog Units (DLU).
    o Borders#DLU21_BORDER, Sizes#DLUX21, Sizes#DLUY21.
    o ColumnSpec#createGap(ConstantSize), RowSpec#createGap(ConstantSize).
    o Added DefaultFormBuilder#setDefaultRowSpec.
    o DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic is public.
    o ColumnSpec#encode, RowSpec#encode, and Size#encode return
      a parseable encoded string specification.
    o ButtonBarBuilder2. It builds betters button bars
      and has a simpler API than the ButtonBarBuilder.
    o FormLayout can honor or ignore the component visibility. Added 
      FormLayout#setHonorsVisibility(boolean) for the container level and
      FormLayout#setHonorsVisibility(Component, Boolean) for a
      component-specific setting that overrides the container default.
    o ButtonStackBuilder(FormLayout, JPanel)


LAYOUT VARIABLES
    
    Layout variables are intended to improve the layout consistency
    in GUIs with many views. And they can improve the readability.
    Variables are used in the encoded column and row specifications.
    They start with the '$' character, for example you can write:
    new FormLayout("pref, $lcgap, pref, $rgap, pref",
                   "p, $lgap, p, $myGap1, p, ${my gap}")
    where $lcgap, $rgap, $lgap are default variables, and $myGap1 
    and ${my gap} are custom variables.
    
    LayoutMaps build a chain; each LayoutMap has an optional parent map.
    The root is defined by LayoutMap#getRoot(). Application-wide variables 
    should be defined in the root LayoutMap. If you want to override
    application-wide variables locally, obtain a LayoutMap using 
    new LayoutMap(), configure it, and provide it as argument to the
    FormLayout, ColumnSpec, and RowSpec constructors/factory methods.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o DefaultUnitConverter ignores changes of the default dialog font
      when computing the global dialog base units.
    o BoundedSize constructor accepts null lower and upper bound.
    o Borders#createEmptyBorder accepts null values.
    o Parser accepts column specs without commas.
        
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Borders#createEmptyBorder returns a Border that benefits
      from the optimization in JComponent#getInsets(Insets).
    o Added tests for the new syntax.
    o Updated download address.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This update fixes minor bugs and comes with a few API changes.
    It is binary incompatible with previous versions of the Forms,
    however the API changes won't affect typical application code.
    
    This version is primarily intended to deliver the API changes
    and tiny improvements that have been made since version 1.0.7.
    I've decided to make smaller steps, and to release updates more 
    frequently. On the other hand, some changes planned for 1.1 
    have been deferred to future versions.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    o Removed deprecated builder constructors:
          AbstractFormBuilder(Container, FormLayout)
          PanelBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout)
          I15dPanelBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout, ResourceBundle)
          DefaultFormBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout)
          DefaultFormBuilder(JPanel, FormLayout, ResourceBundle)
          
      
NEW FEATURES

    o Added PanelBuilder#setBackground and #setOpaque.
    o Added AbstractI15dPanelBuilder to reduce the effort required
      to build internationalized builders for ResourceMaps.
    o Added a debug feature for broken localizations, 
      see the class comment in AbstractI15dPanelBuilder.
    o Added CellConstraints#rc, #rcw, #rchw
    o Added the constructor FormLayout(ColumnSpec[])
    o DefaultComponentFactory is non-final.
    o BoundedSize is public, as well as its sole constructor.
    o Added BoundedSize#getBasis, #getLowerBound, #getUpperBound.
    o Added ConstantSize#getValue, #getUnit.
    o Public ConstantSize(double, Unit) and ConstantSize(int, Unit).
    o FormLayout.Measure is public.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 38: Layout ignores default size if it is bounded
    o Issue 46: DLU size not updated on look&feel changes
    o Issue 54: Utilities#computeIsLafAqua uses name not id
    o Added a missing 'I' in I15dPanelBuilder#add15dTitle(String, String)
        
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o ANT build creates a Maven bundle.
    o Improved DefaultComponentFactory#createSeparator(JLabel) docs.
    o Slightly improved the DefaultFormBuilder tutorial examples.
    o Source code improvements.
    o Marked the FormFactory#createColumnLayout methods as deprecated.
      These will be removed from version 1.2.

                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes a bug in Turkish environments.
    The fix and other changes do not affect the layout. Hence, this 
    version is binary and visually compatible with previous versions.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o Issue 37: String encodings parser fails in Turkish locale.
    
    
DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    The sources now ship in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
    This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
    If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
    point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Issue 36: Some DefaultFormBuilder methods lack return value.
    o Source style improvements.
    o The FAQ is now online.
    o Added references to the Explicit Table Builder, Matisse, Packer.

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.4
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes bugs, comes with a simpler API,
    and provides more JavaDoc examples for frequently used methods.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o ColumnSpec and RowSpec are now immutable. This won't affect
      the typical Forms usage, but may affect visual builder tools.
    o Removed method ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow(JComponent)
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES
  
    o In rare cases the container size may be smaller than before. 
      Bug #4 has been fixed (see below). In 1.0.4 the container
      will be expanded only if components span cols/rows that can grow.
      In 1.0.3 the container could be expanded if *any* col/row grows.
      So some wrong 1.0.3 container expansions won't happen in 1.0.4.
    

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the CellConstraints#xyw method set.
    o Added FormLayoutUtils to the Extras.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o DefaultUnitConverter#setDefaultDialogFont throws NPE.
    o DefaultUnitConverter#setAverageCharacterWidthTestString throws NPE.
    o Invalid sample code in PanelBuilder JavaDocs.
    o (Bug #4) In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. 
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Extended and corrected JavaDoc class comments.
    o Added examples to the JavaDocs of frequently used methods.
    o Refreshed README and FAQ
    o Refreshed whitepaper to demonstrate CellConstraints#xyw.
    o Added two HTML pages: Visual Builders and References.

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.3
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release contains new core classes, adds methods,
    and comes with improved JavaDocs and an extended tutorial and FAQ.
    The DefaultFormBuilder has been moved from the extras to the core.

    Also, the support for the Mac OS X has been improved significantly:
    the DefaultComponentFactory has been adjusted for the Aqua look&feel, 
    the new MacLayoutStyle describes the Mac and Aqua styles guide lines,
    and the ButtonBarBuilder and ButtonBarFactory now honor a button order.
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES

    On the Mac OS X platform Forms 1.0.3 changes the button order;
    other platforms are not affected. In most cases this will improve 
    the user experience of your applications. It is recommended to
    check your ButtonBarBuilder invocation to use a fixed left to right
    order where necessary.
    
    ButtonBarBuilder methods that create sequences of buttons now honor 
    the LayoutStyle's button order. On Mac OS X this is right to left.
    Builder methods that add individual buttons are not affected.
    See the ButtonOrderExample in the tutorial for details on how to
    use or ignore the LayoutStyle's button order.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o Removed deprecated methods from the ButtonBarBuilder class:
      #addGriddedNarrow(JButton)
      #addGriddedNarrowButtons(JButton[])
      #addGriddedGrowingNarrow(JComponent)
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    o Moved DefaultFormBuilder and I15dPanelBuilder to the core.
    o FormLayout is serializable.
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendLabelComponentGapColumn()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendParagraphGapRow()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#setComponentFactory(...) now public
    o I15dPanelBuilder#addI15dLabel(String, CellConstraints, 
                                    Component, CellConstraints)
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginX()
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginY()
    o LayoutStyle#getButtonBarPad()
    o LayoutStyle#isLeftToRightButtonOrder()
    o FormFactory#LABEL_COMPONENT_COLSPEC
    o MacLayoutStyle
    o AbstractFormBuilder#createLeftAdjustedConstraints(int)
    o ColumnSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedColumnSpecs) (final)
    o RowSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedRowSpecs) (final)
    o FormSpec.DefaultAlignment now visible (final)
    o Borders.EmptyBorder provides methods for the 4 sizes.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o PanelBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o DefaultFormBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o Deserialization fails in 1.0.3 preview.
    
    
KNOWN ISSUES

    o In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. See the FAQ for details.
      
 
OTHER CHANGES

    o Code:     Added safety check for invalid constraints in PanelBuilder
                #add(JLabel, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
                #add(String, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
    o Code:     DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic(JLabel) now private
    o Code:     DefaultUnitConverter refers indirectly to ToolKit#getFontMetrics
    o Code:     Marked ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow as deprecated
    o JavaDocs: Extended and corrected 
    o JavaDocs: Clarified some semantics
    o Docs:     Fixed spelling and grammar errors
    o Docs:     Extended and reorganized the FAQ
    o Tutorial: Improved alignment texts in custom row and custom areas example
    o Tutorial: Added ButtonOrderExample
    o Tutorial: Added ComponentOrientationExample
    o Tutorial: Added OrientationUtils to ComponentOrientationExample

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release is a maintenance update that fixes bugs, comes with 
    a new example and a slightly improved and extended documentation.



DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Added a list of FAQ.
    o Added JavaDoc version tags to all class comments.



NEW FEATURES
    
    o DefaultUnitConverter provides bound Bean properties for the 
      default dialog font and the average character width test string.


 
BUGS FIXED

    o Fixed broken button font lookup in DefaultUnitConverter
      that failed to find a font for GTKLookAndFeel, and more
      generally, SynthLookAndFeel subclasses.
    o Fixed #minimumLayoutSize that measured components that span
      multiple columns/rows with the preferredSize, now the minimumsize.
    o Patched the container expansion forced by components that span
      multiple columns/rows for the case that no column or row can grow.
      This expansion shall be performed if and only if the component spans
      an area that can grow. The old behavior performed this action ALWAYS;
      the patch check whether A column/row can grow; 
      the upcoming fix  will check the growing behavior of the spanned area.
      This problem is reflected by the FormLayout unit tests, where currently
      one out of three tests fails, see FormLayoutTests.test*ExtraExpansion*

    o Main:     Removed the final marker from FormDebugPanel; 
                see the class comment for details

    o Tutorial: Added example for custom areas with DefautFormBuilder
    o Tutorial: Changed some text field widths from 'default' to 'min'
    o Tutorial: Corrected frame titles
    o Tests:    Added tests for components that span multiple columns
