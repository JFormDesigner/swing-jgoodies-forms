	The distribution also includes tutorial sources that help you get started.
	
	I recommend read the <i>Quick Start</i> in the HTML documentation,
	to launch the JGoodies Forms Demo while browsing the tutorial sources.

	The accompanying whitepaper describes layout problems, goals, and concepts
	implemented by the JGoodies Forms. 
	You may also study the presentation "Layout and Panel Building" at the

    <h3>Features</h3>
 
	<p>
 		The <tt>FormLayout</tt> has been designed to be powerful, flexible,
    	 precise and easy to learn and understand. It can significantly
     	reduce the time to describe a form and to fill it with components.
     	The layout manager introduces a unique layout feature: 
     	it honors the screen resolution and dialog font size to retain
     	the layout proportions in different environments.
 
	<p>
     	Also, we have seperated the layout task from the panel construction.
     	Therefore we provide a set of non-visual builders that assist you 
     	in defining common panel layouts and in filling a form with components.
     	The JGoodies Forms ships with general purpose builders and builders
     	for specialized layout tasks. For example, the <tt>DefaultFormBuilder</tt>
	helps you build forms with one, two, three, or four columns.
     	The <tt>ButtonBarBuilder</tt> specializes in building button bars.
 
	<p>
 		On top of these non-visual builders the JGoodies Forms provides
 		factories that create the most frequently used layouts, panels,
 		bars and stacks. We recommend to use the factory methods
 		whenever possible; future releases may map a logical panel
 		creation to a concrete creation method that honors the platform
 		and look&amp;feel, for example the Mac vs. Windows button bar
 		layout, where Mac has the default button in the right hand side
 		and Windows in the left.


	<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>
		
	<p>
	The Forms framework ensures the visual quality and consistency of the 
	JGoodies freeware <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/index.html">tools and demos</a> 
	- see yourself.

	<p>
	The finished library you can now download for free has been financed 
	by Johannes Riege,and customers of the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/products/index.html">JGoodies Swing Suite</a>. 
	It is only with their money that I can provide, maintain, and improve 
	this library at no charge.

	<p>
	The form-oriented building has been inspired by the grid layout system 
	as described by Kevin Mullet and Darrel Sano in their book 
	<i>Designing Visual Interfaces</i>. 
	The FormLayout's API has roots in the APIs of TableLayout by Daniel Barbalace, 
	HIGLayout by Daniel Michalik and GridBagLayout by Doug Stein. 
	The concept of dialog units stems from 
	Microsoft user interface implementations.
