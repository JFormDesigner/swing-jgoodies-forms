	<i>Build high quality, consistent Swing UIs quickly</i>
  
	<p>
	The JGoodies Forms framework helps you lay out and implement 
	elegant Swing panels quickly and consistently. 
	It has been designed to make simple things easy and the hard stuff possible,
   	the good design easy and the bad difficult.

	<p><strong>Main Benefits</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Powerful, flexible and precise layout
		<li>Easy to work with and quite easy to learn
		<li>Faster UI production
		<li>Better UI code readability
		<li>Leads to better style guide compliance
	</ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>
 
	<p>
 		The <tt>FormLayout</tt> has been designed to be powerful, flexible,
    	 precise and easy to learn and understand. It can significantly
     	reduce the time to describe a form and to fill it with components.
     	The layout manager introduces a unique layout feature: 
     	it honors the screen resolution and dialog font size to retain
     	the layout proportions in different environments.
 
	<p>
     	Also, we have seperated the layout task from the panel construction.
     	Therefore we provide a set of non-visual builders that assist you 
     	in defining common panel layouts and in filling a form with components.
     	The JGoodies Forms ships with general purpose builders and builders
     	for specialized layout tasks. For example, the <tt>DefaultFormBuilder</tt>
	helps you build forms with one, two, three, or four columns.
     	The <tt>ButtonBarBuilder</tt> specializes in building button bars.
 
	<p>
 		On top of these non-visual builders the JGoodies Forms provides
 		factories that create the most frequently used layouts, panels,
 		bars and stacks. We recommend to use the factory methods
 		whenever possible; future releases may map a logical panel
 		creation to a concrete creation method that honors the platform
 		and look&amp;feel, for example the Mac vs. Windows button bar
 		layout, where Mac has the default button in the right hand side
 		and Windows in the left.


	<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>
		
	<p>
	The Forms framework ensures the visual quality and consistency of the 
	JGoodies freeware <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/index.html">tools and demos</a> 
	- see yourself.


	<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
	
	<p>
	The form-oriented building has been inspired by the grid layout system 
	as described by Kevin Mullet and Darrel Sano in their book 
	<i>Designing Visual Interfaces</i>. 
	The FormLayout’s API has roots in the APIs of 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/tablelayout/">TableLayout</a> by Daniel Barbalace, 
	<a href="http://www.autel.cz/dmi/tutorial.html">HIGLayout</a> by Daniel Michalik and 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/">GridBagLayout</a> by Doug Stein. 
	The concept of dialog units has been taken from 
	Microsoft user interface implementations. 	

	<p>
	The finished library you can now download for free has been financed 
	by sponsors of my Java desktop activities and customers of my products. 
	It is only with their money that I could open source and provide it at no charge. 
	
	<p>
	Many thanks to all these customers and sponsors, especially Johannes Riege 
	and the Java desktop team at Sun Microsystems.
