	<h4><a name="Benefits">What are the main benefits of the JGoodies Forms?</a></h4>

	<p>
	The JGoodies Forms aims to make the layout process faster, better and easier. 
	It has been designed to make simple things easy and the hard stuff possible, 
	good design easy and the bad difficult.	
	</p>
	

	<h4><a name="commercial_use">Can I use the Forms in a commercial product?</a></h4>

	<p>
	You can use, copy and redistribute the JGoodies Forms in source and binary form
	- even for commercial use - if you comply with the very relaxed terms 
	of the <a href="../LICENSE.txt">BSD open source license</a>.
	The BSD license has been chosen, because it allows many uses,
	and the few license terms are short and human readable, 
	even if you're not a lawyer.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="How_to_get_started">How to get started?</a></h4>
	<p>
	First, open and read the README.html and check the available documentation:
	the <em>RELEASE-NOTES</em>, <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Reference</em>, 
	<em>API Docs (JavaDocs)</em>, <em>Tips &amp; Tricks</em>, 
	and <em>Pointers</em> to Visual Builders and other online resources.
	Then study the <em>Advanced Layout</em> presentation or the
	JGoodies Forms <em>Whitepaper</em>; both are available at 
	the <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/">JGoodies articles</a> page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Forms tutorial is an important part of this distribution. 
	It demonstrates different ways to use the Forms library, and
	some typical pitfalls. The tutorial sources ship in folder <tt>src/tutorial</tt>.  
	It is strongly recommended to download and run the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/formsdemo/index.html">JGoodies Forms Demo</a>.
	This demo contains many Forms tutorial examples
	and will aquaint you with the library features.
	</p>



	<h4><a name="Where_do_I_get_the_latest">Where do I get the latest version?</a></h4>

    <p>
	The latest version is available at java.net in the project's 
	<a href="https://forms.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download</a>
	section. There you can get the library, sources, tutorial, documentation, 
	the Forms whitepaper, and the Forms Demo.
    </p>


	<h4><a name="Where_do_I_get_older_versions">Where do I get older versions?</a></h4>

    <p>
	Archived versions are available at java.net in the project's 
	<a href="https://forms.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=622">Archive</a>
	download folder. The Forms version 1.0.2 supports Java 1.3.
    </p>


	<h4><a name="Where_do_I_get_support">Where do I get support?</a></h4>

    <p>
	Support is available only in the user mailing list
	<a href="mailto:users@forms.dev.java.net">users@forms.dev.java.net</a>.
	Before you post, check this FAQ, the relevant JavaDocs,
	and the accompanying tutorial sources.
    You can find and track the progress of Forms issues in the 
	<a href="https://forms.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracker</a>. 
	As a project observer you can log defects, request features and suggest enhancements.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The user mailing list helps us reduce the costs for managing 
	this freeware project. In the mailing list all project users
	can jump in to assist you, if you face a problem with the library or API. 
	And other users can benefit from your questions and our answers.
	Personal mail to JGoodies.com bypasses the other project developers,
	and it often leads to unnecessary extra work; it slows down
	the development process, and it costs time and money on our side.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you have downloaded the library at no charge,
	I ask you to 
	<a href="https://forms.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">register</a> 
    with the user mailing list before you post, and post only with the 
    registered account.
    Otherwise your messages won't show up automatically, 
    and I need to manually accept every message.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Priority support is available for commercial licensees of the 
	<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/products/swingsuite.html">JGoodies Swing Suite</a>. 
	These can contact us by phone or direct questions to support at JGoodies dot com.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	If you have general questions about Swing, layout and design,
	please post to the Java Desktop forums at www.java.net.
	That's a great place to share information with the Java desktop community.
	And we frequently check this forum and participate in discussions.	
	</p>
		


	<h4><a name="How_to_report_a_problem">How to report a problem?</a></h4>
	<p>
	Before you report a problem, check this FAQ, the relevant JavaDocs,
	and the accompanying tutorial sources.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you think you've found a bug in the JGoodies Forms, 
	please check the issue tracker or ask in the user mailing list, 
	if this issue is already known.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you report a bug, please provide at least the following information:
	JRE vendor, JRE version, JRE build, OS, OS version, Forms version,
	and whether the problem can be reproduced with the
	JGoodies Forms Demo or not.
	For example: <em>Sun Java 1.5.0_06, Windows XP, Validation 1.1.1, 
	can be reproduced with the JGoodies Forms Demo</em>. 
	Please point us to the Forms Demo, if it shows a problem.
	If you cannot reproduce the problem with the Forms Demo,
	please describe the steps to produce the problem.
	Often a screenshot makes it easier to understand a problem,
	or a request for an enhancement.
