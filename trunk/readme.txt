                 JGoodies Forms(tm) Version 1.0.1
     

INTRODUCTION

     The JGoodies Forms framework helps you layout and 
     implement elegant Swing panels quickly and consistently. 
     It makes simple things easy and the hard stuff possible,
     the good design easy and the bad difficult.
          
     The Forms distribution ships with tutorial sources, and
     you can find a Forms Demo and more Swing applications 
     that utilize the Forms at www.JGoodies.com/freeware/.
     
     The Forms framework requires Java 1.3 or later.
