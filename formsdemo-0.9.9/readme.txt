INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE WINDOWS EDITION

     Be sure to have Java 1.3 or later installed before running the setup 
     of the Windows edition without Java. To install a Windows edition, 
     run the exe-file and follow the setup instructions.

     You can invoke the application from the 'Start > Programs' menu.



INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE JAVA-ENABLED EDITION

     The Java-enabled edition is a ZIP archive that contains:
       1) formsdemo.jar  - a signed executable JAR-file
       2) formsdemo.ico  - a Windows icon file
       3) changes.txt    - the change history
       4) license.txt    - the license agreement
       5) readme.txt     - this readme file

     Extract the files from the ZIP archive. Do not extract files from 
     the JAR. Then run the application and follow the setup instructions.

     To run the demo from a command-line, change directory to
     where the JAR-file is located. Then execute:
        java -jar looksdemo.jar

     On most platforms you can launch the application by using a 
     platform-specific mechanism to launch the executable JAR file.
     For example, on MS Windows you can double-click the JAR.

     You can launch the demo with a single click from your Web browser.
     This requires Java Web Start technology version 1.0.1 or later.
