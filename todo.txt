JGoodies Forms(tm) To-Do
========================

o Sanity check: no negative sizes, e.g. no "-7dlu".

o Check API in ButtonBarBuilder2
  
o Add tests for the existing syntax parser checks

o Add tests for the new multiplier feature

o Forms 2.0:
  - make DLU a unit 
  - change ButtonBarBuilder opaque default to false
  - repace DLUX and DLUY by DLU and change the Sizes API
    to hand over the orientation

o Add a reference to the explicit-tablelayout project;
  update the whitepaper to mention this layout system.
  
o Check the visual builder tools for an active project state,
  especially Gerald Rosenberg's JFormComposer and the
  SwingEmpire FormBuilder.

o Integrate Karl Tauber's customization code

o Consider adding a second set of factory methods
  to the Button*Factories that use Actions as parameters.
  
o Add more examples to constructors and frequently used methods.

o Add tutorial examples that explains how to align labels with text areas.
  Much like the examples "Building - Custom Rows" and "Building - "Custom Areas".

o Add exercise 8 from the JGoodies Training to 
  the tutorial's pitfalls section.
  
o Add an example where the DefaultFormBuilder 
  is more complex than a PanelBuilder.

o Add custom ComponentFactory example

o Consider replacing FormLayout#insertColumn by #addColumn
  with a column range of [1, columnCount].

o Move example title and comment from the Forms Demo
  to the examples.
  
o Extend unit tests:
   + test rounding behavior
   + test computed bounds
   + test the resizing behavior
o Overhaul the titled separator:
   + honor the component orientation 
   + get title font and color from a TitledBorder, not the UIDefaults
o Improve parser error messages
o Improve DefaultFormBuilder's support for dynamically
  added custom rows
  
o Mac OS X:
  + AquaLayoutStyle
  + TitledSeparator font plain, not bold?
  
  
o Documentation:
  + Write a tutorial
  + Explain #add and #append builder naming conventions
    and their contracts.
  + Provide the JavaDocs online at forms.dev.java.net or JGoodies.com
  
o Discussions:
  + logical sizes
  + requirements for perceived bounds and font baseline alignment
  + powerful sizing specification beyond min/pref/max.
    May map a component size to a fitness value
    so one can specify a preferred range, not just a single value.
  
o Consider the following extensions/changes:
  + add PanelBuilder.getRemainingColumns()
  + DefaultFormBuilder.appendComponentRow(RowSpec)
