JGoodies Forms(tm) To-Do
========================

o Integrate Karl Tauber's customization code

o Add more examples to constructors and frequently used methods.

o Add tutorial examples that explains how to align labels with text areas.
  Much like the examples "Building - Custom Rows" and "Building - "Custom Areas".

o Add custom ComponentFactory example

o Move example title and comment from the Forms Demo
  to the examples.
  
o Extend unit tests:
   + test rounding behavior
   + test computed bounds
   + test the resizing behavior
o Overhaul the titled separator:
   + honor the component orientation 
   + get title font and color from a TitledBorder, not the UIDefaults
o Improve parser error messages
o Improve DefaultFormBuilder's support for dynamically
  added custom rows
  
o Mac OS X:
  + AquaLayoutStyle
  + TitledSeparator font plain, not bold?
  
  
o Documentation:
  + Write a tutorial
  + Explain #add and #append builder naming conventions
    and their contracts.
  + Provide the JavaDocs online at forms.dev.java.net or JGoodies.com
  
o Discussions:
  + logical sizes
  + requirements for perceived bounds and font baseline alignment
  + powerful sizing specification beyond min/pref/max.
    May map a component size to a fitness value
    so one can specify a preferred range, not just a single value.
  
o Consider the following extensions/changes:
  + add PanelBuilder.getRemainingColumns()
  + DefaultFormBuilder.appendComponentRow(RowSpec)
