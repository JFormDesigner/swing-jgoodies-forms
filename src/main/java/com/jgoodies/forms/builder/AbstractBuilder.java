/**
 * An abstract class that minimizes the effort required to implement
 * non-visual builders that use the {@link FormLayout}.<p>
 *
 * Builders hide details of the FormLayout and provide convenience behavior
 * that assists you in constructing a form, bar, stack.
 * This class provides a cell cursor that helps you traverse a form while
 * you add components. Also, it offers several methods to append custom
 * and logical columns and rows.
