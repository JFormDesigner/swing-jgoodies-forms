                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.4
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release fixes bugs, comes with a simpler API,
    and provides more JavaDoc examples for frequently used methods.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o ColumnSpec and RowSpec are now immutable. This won't affect
      the typical Forms usage, but may affect visual builder tools.
    o Removed method ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow(JComponent)
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES
  
    o In rare cases the container size may be smaller than before. 
      Bug #4 has been fixed (see below). In 1.0.4 the container
      will be expanded only if components span cols/rows that can grow.
      In 1.0.3 the container could be expanded if *any* col/row grows.
      So some wrong 1.0.3 container expansions won't happen in 1.0.4.
    

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the CellConstraints#xyw method set.
    o Added FormLayoutUtils to the Extras.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o DefaultUnitConverter#setDefaultDialogFont throws NPE.
    o DefaultUnitConverter#setAverageCharacterWidthTestString throws NPE.
    o Invalid sample code in PanelBuilder JavaDocs.
    o (Bug #4) In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. 
    
    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Extended and corrected JavaDoc class comments.
    o Added examples to the JavaDocs of frequently used methods.
    o Refreshed README and FAQ
    o Refreshed whitepaper to demonstrate CellConstraints#xyw.
    o Added two HTML pages: Visual Builders and References.

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.3
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This maintenance release contains new core classes, adds methods,
    and comes with improved JavaDocs and an extended tutorial and FAQ.
    The DefaultFormBuilder has been moved from the extras to the core.

    Also, the support for the Mac OS X has been improved significantly:
    the DefaultComponentFactory has been adjusted for the Aqua look&feel, 
    the new MacLayoutStyle describes the Mac and Aqua styles guide lines,
    and the ButtonBarBuilder and ButtonBarFactory now honor a button order.
    
    
VISUAL INCOMPATIBILITIES

    On the Mac OS X platform Forms 1.0.3 changes the button order;
    other platforms are not affected. In most cases this will improve 
    the user experience of your applications. It is recommended to
    check your ButtonBarBuilder invocation to use a fixed left to right
    order where necessary.
    
    ButtonBarBuilder methods that create sequences of buttons now honor 
    the LayoutStyle's button order. On Mac OS X this is right to left.
    Builder methods that add individual buttons are not affected.
    See the ButtonOrderExample in the tutorial for details on how to
    use or ignore the LayoutStyle's button order.
    
    
API INCOMPATIBILITIES

    o Removed deprecated methods from the ButtonBarBuilder class:
      #addGriddedNarrow(JButton)
      #addGriddedNarrowButtons(JButton[])
      #addGriddedGrowingNarrow(JComponent)
    

NEW FEATURES
    
    o Moved DefaultFormBuilder and I15dPanelBuilder to the core.
    o FormLayout is serializable.
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendLabelComponentGapColumn()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#appendParagraphGapRow()
    o AbstractFormBuilder#setComponentFactory(...) now public
    o I15dPanelBuilder#addI15dLabel(String, CellConstraints, 
                                    Component, CellConstraints)
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginX()
    o LayoutStyle#getTabbedDialogMarginY()
    o LayoutStyle#getButtonBarPad()
    o LayoutStyle#isLeftToRightButtonOrder()
    o FormFactory#LABEL_COMPONENT_COLSPEC
    o MacLayoutStyle
    o AbstractFormBuilder#createLeftAdjustedConstraints(int)
    o ColumnSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedColumnSpecs) (final)
    o RowSpec#decodeSpecs(String encodedRowSpecs) (final)
    o FormSpec.DefaultAlignment now visible (final)
    o Borders.EmptyBorder provides methods for the 4 sizes.
    
    
BUGS FIXED

    o PanelBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o DefaultFormBuilder fails to build right-to-left if column span > 1.
    o Deserialization fails in 1.0.3 preview.
    
    
KNOWN ISSUES

    o In some cases components that span multiple columns/rows 
      can expand the container size, although none of the spanned
      columns/rows are allowed to grow. See the FAQ for details.
      
 
OTHER CHANGES

    o Code:     Added safety check for invalid constraints in PanelBuilder
                #add(JLabel, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
                #add(String, CellConstraints, Component, CellConstraints)
    o Code:     DefaultComponentFactory#setTextAndMnemonic(JLabel) now private
    o Code:     DefaultUnitConverter refers indirectly to ToolKit#getFontMetrics
    o Code:     Marked ButtonStackBuilder#addGriddedNarrow as deprecated
    o JavaDocs: Extended and corrected 
    o JavaDocs: Clarified some semantics
    o Docs:     Fixed spelling and grammar errors
    o Docs:     Extended and reorganized the FAQ
    o Tutorial: Improved alignment texts in custom row and custom areas example
    o Tutorial: Added ButtonOrderExample
    o Tutorial: Added ComponentOrientationExample
    o Tutorial: Added OrientationUtils to ComponentOrientationExample

                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release is a maintenance update that fixes bugs, comes with 
    a new example and a slightly improved and extended documentation.



DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Added a list of FAQ.
    o Added JavaDoc version tags to all class comments.



NEW FEATURES
    
    o DefaultUnitConverter provides bound Bean properties for the 
      default dialog font and the average character width test string.


 
BUGS FIXED

    o Fixed broken button font lookup in DefaultUnitConverter
      that failed to find a font for GTKLookAndFeel, and more
      generally, SynthLookAndFeel subclasses.
    o Fixed #minimumLayoutSize that measured components that span
      multiple columns/rows with the preferredSize, now the minimumsize.
    o Patched the container expansion forced by components that span
      multiple columns/rows for the case that no column or row can grow.
      This expansion shall be performed if and only if the component spans
      an area that can grow. The old behavior performed this action ALWAYS;
      the patch check whether A column/row can grow; 
      the upcoming fix  will check the growing behavior of the spanned area.
      This problem is reflected by the FormLayout unit tests, where currently
      one out of three tests fails, see FormLayoutTests.test*ExtraExpansion*


    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Main:     Removed the final marker from FormDebugPanel; 
                see the class comment for details
    o Main:     Removed FormDebugPanel features that are available 
                in the FormDebugUtils

    o Main:     Border.BUTTON_BAR_GAP_BORDER uses dlu only.
    o Main:     Faster conversion of sizes with a 0 value.
    o Tutorial: Added example for custom areas with DefautFormBuilder
    o Tutorial: Changed some text field widths from 'default' to 'min'
    o Tutorial: Corrected frame titles
    o Tests:    Added tests for components that span multiple columns
    o Tests:    Specialized some exceptions in catch clauses
    o Docs:     Improved grouping diagrams
    o Docs:     Fixed invalid link to a tutorial pdf
    o All code: Documented empty blocks.
