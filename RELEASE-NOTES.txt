                    JGoodies Forms, Version 1.0.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release is a maintenance update that fixes bugs, comes with 
    a new example and a slightly improved and extended documentation.



DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    o Added a list of FAQ.
    o Added JavaDoc version tags to all class comments.



NEW FEATURES
    
    o DefaultUnitConverter provides bound Bean properties for the 
      default dialog font and the average character width test string.


 
BUGS FIXED

    o Fixed broken button font lookup in DefaultUnitConverter
      that failed to find a font for GTKLookAndFeel, and more
      generally, SynthLookAndFeel subclasses.
    o Fixed #minimumLayoutSize that measured components that span
      multiple columns/rows with the preferredSize, now the minimumsize.
    o Patched the container expansion forced by components that span
      multiple columns/rows for the case that no column or row can grow.
      This expansion shall be performed if and only if the component spans
      an area that can grow. The old behavior performed this action ALWAYS;
      the patch check whether A column/row can grow; 
      the upcoming fix  will check the growing behavior of the spanned area.
      This problem is reflected by the FormLayout unit tests, where currently
      one out of three tests fails, see FormLayoutTests.test*ExtraExpansion*


    
OTHER CHANGES

    o Main:     Removed the final marker from FormDebugPanel; 
                see the class comment for details
    o Main:     Removed FormDebugPanel features that are available 
                in the FormDebugUtils
    o Main:     Extended JavaDoc for the DefaultUnitConverter
    o Extras:   Extended JavaDoc for the DefaultFormBuilder
    o Tutorial: Added example for custom areas with DefautFormBuilder
    o Tutorial: Changed some text field widths from 'default' to 'min'
    o Tutorial: Corrected frame titles
    o Tests:    Added tests for components that span multiple columns
    o Tests:    Specialized some exceptions in catch clauses
    o Docs:     Improved grouping diagrams
    o Docs:     Fixed invalid link to a tutorial pdf
    o All code: Documented empty blocks.
